# RSbench

This is the official codebase for "RSbench: A Benchmark Suite for Systematically Evaluating Reasoning Shortcuts." This suite provides tools to evaluate and generate datasets focused on Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs) .

## Content Overview

- **`rsscount`**: Use this module to count RSs in your datasets.
  
- **`rsseval`**: Evaluate the presence and impact of RSs using the `rsbench` datasets.
  
- **`rssgen`**: Generate datasets designed to study and analyze RSs effectively.

Each component is designed to help you systematically assess and understand RSs in various machine learning models.
