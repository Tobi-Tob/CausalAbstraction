# RSbench

This is the official codebase for ["A Neuro-Symbolic Benchmark Suite for Concept Quality and Reasoning Shortcuts"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10368) paper, [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/). This suite provides tools to evaluate and generate datasets focused on [Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19951) .

## Content Overview

- **`rsscount`**: Use this module to count RSs in your datasets.
  
- **`rsseval`**: Evaluate the presence and impact of RSs using the `rsbench` datasets.
  
- **`rssgen`**: Generate datasets designed to study and analyze RSs effectively.

Each component is designed to help you systematically assess and understand RSs in various machine learning models.
